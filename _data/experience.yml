    This position is responsible for developing the solutions of computer vision.  Overall, I takes about 20% on requirement engineering, 50% on paper work, including paper study, proof of concept and deriving the mathematical formula.  The remaining 30% is used for architect and implementation.  I think this position needs good communication and sense of mathematics.  A good communication can pool different kind of sense together to find the best solution, and a good sense of mathematics provide an efficient diagnosis while facing issues.
