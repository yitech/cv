    During my time of NCTU I specialize in <mark>Probability and Statistical Computing</mark>, which is a branch of Computer Science and Statistics.  I have good understanding of fundamental science and can apply the cutting-edge paper efficiently.
    
    My [thesis](https://ir.nctu.edu.tw/handle/11536/138580) is a study of <mark>Dynamic Weighted Monto Carlo Markov Chain</mark>(MCMC).  MCMC is a widely used statistical computing method.  However, the inefficient convergence property is notorious in application.  We purpose a weighted scheme of MCMC to enhance the convergence and provide a numerical and mathematical proof of the efficientcy.
